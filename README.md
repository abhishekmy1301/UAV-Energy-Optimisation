# UAV-Energy-Optimisation

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as UAVs, are drones which have many uses such as cargo
delivery, surveillance, and agriculture. However, they also have another use which is extremely helpful, and
it is that they can extend the range of cell towers and/or increase the speed of the network. This study
investigates the factors that affect the energy consumption of UAV-BS, and how different TSP algorithms
affect the energy consumption of the UAV, for different models of UAVs. The problem to be solved is
finding the optimum path trajectory of the base station depending on the number of nodes and the distance
between the nodes. UAVs which do not have enough energy to complete the full tour, the TSP tour will
be split into clusters. where UAVs will return to the starting node to recharge and thereafter complete the
remaining clusters.
